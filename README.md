# algotraining
with all the platforms we use to work on algos, i got tired of the varying (and inferior) qualities of their IDE's and decided that I wanted to start solving these bad boys in a red-green testing dev flow. Really this is just a personal central repository that I'm sharing with anyone that may be interested.
Starting with jest unit tests and iterating on top of a forked repo i've had for a while,  
Feel free to drop a msg with any constuctive dialogue but just keep in mind that I don't claim my solutions to always be fully optimized. I tend to drop pretty explicit pseudocode as it actualizes my thought process, have a tendency to use arrow function assignments and love the beauty of recursion... but that's just my style.

Feel free to fork and clone your own playground. add more problems and build up the tests. or not. just sharing my approaches! 


## __tests__
Jest testrunner
- Open a terminal session and navigate to your algotraining directory
- Type `npm run testAlgo <hh-filename>` 
  - ex. `npm run testAlgo fizzbuzz`
- The tests for the extension hack hours are disabled by default so if you get to them, you'll need to enable them to check your work. To enable them, open up the appropriate test file in the `./__tests__` directory and change `xdescribe` to `describe`.



## What are Hack Hours?
Hack hours are a series of algorithm problems to refine your problem solving skills. You will be presented a new algorithm problem every day.  Think of this as taking your brain to the gym.  The more you exercise these skills, the more prepared you'll be for the job search.  If you're working on these algorithm problems every day, the ones you see in interviews will just be another algorithm.  

Make sure you read through and understand the challenge, then work through your approach.  Often, the first attempt will be a brute force solution.  Examine that solution to see if there's some time or space complexity that could be saved using a different approach.  Other times, you may not get to the solution at all.  It is still valuable time spent making the effort.  Even if you don't solve the problem, you will benefit from the exercise.  Just keep building that muscle so it's there when you need it!

## What do I need to do to get initial setup done for Hack Hours?
#### Note: Each of these steps should only be done once!

- Fork this repo =)  This will create a repo on Github under your account.
