/*
  * Below, you are provided the construtors for a doubly linked list as well as a constructor for the nodes it's composed of

  * Construct a doubly linked list & modify it's prototype to contain methods named 'add' and 'remove'
  * The 'add' method should add an additional node to the end of the doubly linked list
  * The 'remove' method should remove the first instance of a node containing a specific value from the doubly linked list
  

Example after using 'add' method to add 6
null <-> 4 <-> 9 <-> 2 <-> 1 <-> 6 <-> null

Example after using 'remove' method to remove 2
null <-> 4 <-> 9 <-> 1 <-> 6 <-> null

NOTE: must use non-arrow functions for object constructors and prototype methods
@see: https://dmitripavlutin.com/when-not-to-use-arrow-functions-in-javascript/
